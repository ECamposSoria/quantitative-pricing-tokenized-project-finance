# Platform Comparison: Centrifuge vs Alternatives

## Centrifuge/Tinlake (Selected)
- TVL: ~$1.45B; RWA-focused with CFG governance token.
- Fees: ~15 bps protocol fee on redemptions; CFG incentives attract LPs.
- Strengths: Purpose-built for tokenized debt pools, established compliance (Reg D/S), no sponsor capital trapped as LP.

## Maple Finance
- Positioning: Institutional credit marketplace with higher minimums.
- Fees: Manager/servicer fees typically higher than 15 bps; LP base narrower than Centrifuge’s CFG-driven pools.

## Goldfinch
- Positioning: Off-chain private credit with higher LP returns; concentrated manager risk.
- Fees/Spreads: Higher spread to LPs vs protocol fee; less suitable for low-vol RWA debt tokens.

## Traditional SPV Servicer
- Fees: 50–100 bps servicing/admin typical.
- Drawbacks: No protocol incentives, slower reporting, no on-chain transparency benefits.

## Selection Rationale
- Chosen: **Centrifuge/Tinlake** for lowest fee, CFG incentives, and RWA-native infrastructure.
- Alternatives are either costlier (traditional servicer), narrower (Maple), or risk-concentrated (Goldfinch).
