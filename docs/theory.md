- Constant product invariant: `x * y = k`, fee collected on the input leg.
- Concentrated liquidity: liquidity `L` deployed over range `[tick_lower, tick_upper)`.
- Impermanent loss approximation: `IL = 2√r / (1 + r) - 1`, where `r` is price ratio.

Full derivations and proofs will be added in later iterations.
